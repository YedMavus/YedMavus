  <summary> Summary </summary>
  A high-level language to express quantum programs meeting the requirements of the polyhedral model; Exploration of off-the-shelf loop transformations on affine quantum circuits.
</details>

[*OCC: An Automated End-to-End Machine Learning Optimizing Compiler for Computing-In-Memory*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9502921/)
Adam Siemieniuk, Lorenzo Chelini, Asif Ali Khan, Jeronimo Castrillon, Andi Drebes, Henk Corporaal, Tobias Grosser, Martin Kong
in EEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,
2021
<details>
  <summary> Summary </summary>
  We propose a novel ML optimization framework for CIM (memristor crossbar-based) accelerators. We leverage the new MLIR pipepline and propose crossbar specific transformations to improve application performance and crossbar lifetime.
</details>

[*Tile Size Selection of Affine Programs for GPGPUs using Polyhedral Cross-Compilation.*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3447818.3460369)
Khaled Abdelaal and Martin Kong in
International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS), 
June, 2021. [*Artifact Available*](https://github.com/mkongiv/polycross-comp-ics21).
<details>
<summary> Summary</summary>
In (almost) one line: We model the tile memory footprint induced by the chosen tile size under 3 loop fusion structures. A notion of ``balance'' is introduced to favor two heuristics, vector mode and reuse mode.
</details>

[*Automatic Generation of Multi-Objective Polyhedral Compiler Transformations.*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3410463.3414635)
Lorenzo Chelini, Tobias Gysi, Tobias Grosser, Martin Kong, Henk Corporaal in
International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT),
October, 2020.
<details>
<summary> Summary</summary>
In one line: a database approach to polyhedral compiler transformations. Will expand this later :-)
